xslt2js
=======

An XSLT file and supporting code for transforming/compiling XSLT documents into equivalent Javascript files for improved efficiency and compatibility.

It is currently not ready for even the most basic use cases.

Once complete, I will pass the XSLT to itself AND TEAR THE VERY FABRIC OF REALITY...uh, I mean, produce a Javascript equivalent of the xslt2js stylesheet for compiling other XSLT files from within the browser, which can then be executed using a Javascript 'eval'.
